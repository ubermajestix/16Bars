# TODO
1. Moved to Arduino, software for basic operation done. 
2. Need to redo schematic for Nano, reset jack, bar clock, first bar, middle bar, last bar, and 4 pin header for seven segment sub-board. 
3. Reduce to 4HP.
4. Is SevenSegment more stable with shift registers controlled by Arduino? 4033 docs say they are easily inteferred with, and they seem a little wonky, maybe it's my soldering, but they don't always work.
