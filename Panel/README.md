# 16 Bars Panel

## Inspiration
16Winds name was inspired by a joke my wife and I made years ago when
I was doing side work to pay for our honeymoon. I would start my side
gig at 5:30am, work until my real job started at 8:30am, work a full
day, hit the gym around 5:30pm, cook dinner, hang out, enjoy some music
hobby time, relax together, and maybe knock out a few todo items. Late
into the evening we would joke we were on our 16th wind, instead of just 
a second wind, to get everything done in a day. 

When I started thinking about making synth modules I thought the name was
fitting as our lives have only gotten more busy with kids and work. The
time I'm able to spend working on this has drastically reduced and I really
feel like I'm on a 16th wind to get the energy to figure out electronics,
pcb design, panel design, manufacturing, part selection, branding and everything
else.

So 16Winds, how about naming the modules after the names given to the compass winds
(Borreas, Zephyrus, etc) thoughout antiquity, or maybe use the names of local winds (chinook, mistral, etc). 

## How To Get Artwork On The Panel
1. Design in InkScape
4. Use Svg2Shenzhen to setup layers
6. Resize artwork and place in layers (Svg2Shenzhen resizes the artboard, maybe I'm doing something wrong?)
7. Export to Kicad in a Footprints/ directory local to the project
8. Add local Footprints/ as a "Project Specific Library" in KiCad's Footprint Library Manager
9. Place footprints from new library.
